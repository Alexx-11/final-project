            <h1 class="HIM">Alex Jones-Founder&CEO (Left)</h1>
            <br>
        <p class="almost">Alex is a 14-year-old boy growing up in Oakland, CA. Alex is heading into his Freshman year of High School and will be attending Head-Royce for the duration. One of Alex’s greatest passions is basketball as this upcoming season he will be playing with the Head-Royce Varsity hoping to help repeat back2back NCS championships. Sports takes up a lot of his time but when he’s free he secretly loves to draw. Alex had the idea for this company after he had experienced thrift shopping for the first time himself. He then called his friends to pitch the idea, and here we are.</p>

            <h2 class="mya">Myles Staples-Head Clothing Director (Right)</h2>
            <br>
        <p class="not">Myles Staples is also a 14-year-old boy growing up in Oakland, CA just like Alex and Colin. He is heading into his Freshman year at Oakland Tech, further pursuing his basketball dreams, while also following in his brother’s footsteps as he is now a Sophomore at Stanford College after graduating from Tech. Myles and Alex have known each other since their very early ages in life, being friends ever since. When Alex called him to tell him about the idea, Myles was instantly on board especially because he is in charge of the clothing department, a perfect fit because he has such a great taste in style (no glaze).</p>

            <h3 class="shc">Colin Wicks-Main Product Developer (Middle)</h3>
            <br>
        <p class="brother">Colin is also a 14-year-old just like the other two also growing up in Oakland, CA. Colin, heading into his Freshman year at Sacred Heart Cathedral, is looking forward to seeing all those new faces and to play football. This trio has been like brothers since the day they met, so it only made sense that Colin was added to this start up. He also had a good taste in style and knowing what people like, and working with products online.</p>
